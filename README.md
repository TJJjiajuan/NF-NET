# NF-NET [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.12539609.svg)]
 Nonfunctional pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (NF-PanNETs) exhibit varied clinical behaviors ranging from indolent to highly malignant. Current understanding of the molecular pathology of NF-PanNETs is insufficient for their clinical management, with a recognized challenge being the need to identify patients with aggressive tumors who should receive intensive therapeutic interventions. This study aims to characterize the gene expression and chromatin regulatory landscape of NF-PanNET tumors, to explore pro-cancer regulatory mechanisms, and to identify both potential therapeutic targets and prognostic biomarker(s) for NF-PanNETs.

In this study, through scRNA-seq (n=10) and scATAC-seq (n=4) profiling, we characterized the gene expression and chromatin regulatory landscape of clinically resected NF-PanNET tumors, ultimately discovering the pro-cancer impacts of AGR2high cells. Moreover, and beyond showing that the transcription factor FOXM1 directly drives this cell type’s proliferative transcriptional programmed demonstrating that chemical inhibition of this master regulator confers therapeutic benefits, our study demonstrates the excellent performance of simple IHC staining against AGR2 as a clinically informative marker of NF-PanNET prognosis.
