# NF-NET
Design: We integrated datasets, comprising single cell RNA-seq data from 10 patients, single cell ATAC-seq data from 4 patients, and bulk RNA-seq data from 77 patients, to construct an integrated atlas encompassing both tumor and non-tumor cells within human NF-PanNETs tumor tissues. We then harnessed this atlas for follow-up analyses and experiments aimed at elucidating potential mechanisms underlying NF-PanNETs malignancy. The prognostic significance of our novel biomarker was validated in a cohort of 177 NF-PanNETs patients from two different institutions, all of whom lacked germline mutations.
Result: We have pinpointed a distinct subcluster of tumor cells, referred to as “atypical tumor cells”, responsible for driving the malignancy of NF-PanNETs. Within this subcluster, FOXM1 serves as a central transcription factor, orchestrating the transcriptional program that underlies the malignancy of NF-PanNETs. Additionally, we identified AGR2 as a novel prognostic marker. Patients with AGR2-positive NF-PanNETs exhibited several adverse prognostic factors, and as a result, experienced significantly poorer progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).
